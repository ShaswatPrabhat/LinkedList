# LinkedList

LinkedList implementation in Python

If we want to get the ith element, we have to traverse from the head node one by one.

It takes us O(N) time on average to visit an element by index, where N is the length of the linked list.

## Advantages

Unlike an array, we donâ€™t need to move all elements past the inserted element.

Therefore, you can insert a new node into a linked list in O(1) time complexity, which is very efficient.
